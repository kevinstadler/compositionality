  abstract = {This article mentions that a formal view of compositional semantics is helpful both for what it reveals about the structure of language and also for what it deletes, including context, the use of compositionality to index rather than define meaning, and the role of idioms. It also discusses how Construction Grammar (CG) allows one to incorporate idioms into a framework in which compositionality may sometimes use familiar sequences of words as atoms when the meanings of single words do not themselves contribute to the meaning of the whole. Schema Theory shows what is meant by embodied meaning, and the way it is embedded in social experience. Linguists working within CG, with its close relations to Cognitive Grammar, have teased out the rule-governed and productive linguistic behaviors specific to each family of constructions.},

@article{Atkinson2015,
  abstract = {A learner's linguistic input is more variable if it comes from a greater number of speakers. Higher speaker input variability has been shown to facilitate the acquisition of phonemic boundaries, since data drawn from multiple speakers provides more information about the distribution of phonemes in a speech community. It has also been proposed that speaker input variability may have a systematic influence on individual-level learning of morphology, which can in turn influence the group-level characteristics of a language. Languages spoken by larger groups of people have less complex morphology than those spoken in smaller communities. While a mechanism by which the number of speakers could have such an effect is yet to be convincingly identified, differences in speaker input variability, which is thought to be larger in larger groups, may provide an explanation. By hindering the acquisition, and hence faithful cross-generational transfer, of complex morphology, higher speaker input variability may result in structural simplification. We assess this claim in two experiments which investigate the effect of such variability on language learning, considering its influence on a learner's ability to segment a continuous speech stream and acquire a morphologically complex miniature language. We ultimately find no evidence to support the proposal that speaker input variability influences language learning and so cannot support the hypothesis that it explains how population size determines the structural properties of language.},

  abstract = {Previous research by Kirby et al. has found that strikingly compositional language systems can be developed in the laboratory via iterated learning of an artificial language. However, our reanalysis of the data indicates that while iterated learning prompts an increase in language compositionality, the increase is followed by an apparent decrease. This decrease in compositionality is inexplicable, and seems to arise from chance events in a small dataset (four transmission chains). The current study thus investigates the iterated emergence of language structure on a larger scale using Amazon Mechanical Turk, encompassing twenty-four independent chains of learners over ten generations. This richer dataset provides further evidence that iterated learning causes languages to become more compositional, although the trend levels off before the 10th generation. Moreover, analysis of the data (and reanalysis of Kirby et al.) reveals that systematic units arise along some meaning dimensions before others, giving insight into the biases of learners.},

  abstract = {A growing body of work demonstrates that syntactic structure can evolve in populations of genetically identical agents. Traditional explanations for the emergence of syntactic structure employ an argument based on genetic evolution: Syntactic structure is specified by an innate language acquisition device (LAD). Knowledge of language is complex, yet the data available to the language learner are sparse. This incongruous situation, termed the “poverty of the stimulus,” is accounted for by placing much of the specification of language in the LAD. The assumption is that the characteristic structure of language is somehow coded genetically. The effect of language evolution on the cultural substrate, in the absence of genetic change, is not addressed by this explanation. We show that the poverty of the stimulus introduces a pressure for compositional language structure when we consider language evolution resulting from iterated observational learning. We use a mathematical model to map the space of parameters that result in compositional syntax. Our hypothesis is that compositional syntax cannot be explained by understanding the LAD alone: Compositionality is an emergent property of the dynamics resulting from sparse language exposure.},

The major transitions in evolution. Oxford: Oxford Univ. Press; 1995]. According to this view language codes cultural information and as such forms the basis for the evolution of complexity in human culture. In this article we develop the theory that language also codes information in another sense: languages code information on their own structure. As a result, languages themselves provide information that influences their own survival. To understand the consequences of this theory we discuss recent computational models of linguistic evolution. Linguistic evolution is the process by which languages themselves evolve. This article draws together this recent work on linguistic evolution and highlights the significance of this process in understanding the evolution of linguistic complexity. Our conclusions are that: (1) the process of linguistic transmission constitutes the basis for an evolutionary system, and (2), that this evolutionary system is only superficially comparable to the process of biological evolution.},

When linguistic signals are produced to inform other individuals, individuals that respond appropriately to these signals may increase their reproductive chances but it is less clear what the reproductive advantage is for the language producers. We present simulations in which populations of neural networks living in an environment evolve a simple language with an informative function.

@phdthesis{Cornish2011,
  abstract = {Human languages are not just tools for transmitting cultural ideas, they are themselves culturally transmitted. This single observation has major implications for our understanding of how and why languages around the world are structured the way they are, and also for how scientists should be studying them. Accounting for the origins of what turns out to be such a uniquely human ability is, and should be, a priority for anyone interested in what makes us different from every other lifeform on Earth. The way the scientific community thinks about language has seen considerable changes over the years. In particular, we have witnessed movements away from a purely descriptive science of language, towards a more explanatory framework that is willing to embrace the difficult questions of not just how individual languages are currently structured and used, but also how and why they got to be that way in the first place. Seeing languages as historical entities is, of course, nothing new in linguistics. Seeing languages as complex adaptive systems, undergoing processes of evolution at multiple levels of interaction however, is. Broadly speaking, this thesis explores some of the implications that this perspective on language has, and argues that in addition to furthering our understanding of the processes of biological evolution and the mechanisms of individual learning required specifically for language, we also need to be mindful of the less well-understood cultural processes that mediate between the two. Human communication systems are not just direct expressions of our genes. Neither are they independently acquired by learners anew at every generation. Instead, languages are transmitted culturally from one generation to another, creating an opportunity for a different kind of evolutionary channel to exist. It is a central aim of this thesis to explore some of the adaptive dynamics that such a cultural channel has, and investigate the extent to which certain structural and statistical properties of language can be directly explained as adaptations to the transmission process and the learning biases of speakers. In order to address this aim, this thesis takes an experimental approach. Building on a rich set of empirical results from various computational simulations and mathematical models, it presents a novel methodological framework for exploring one type of cultural transmission mechanism, iterated learning, in the laboratory using human participants. In these experiments, we observe the evolution of artificial languages as they are acquired and then transmitted to new learners. Although there is no communication involved in these studies, and participants are unaware that their learning efforts are being propagated to future learners, we find that many functional features of language emerge naturally from the different constraints imposed upon them during transmission. These constraints can take a variety of forms, both internal and external to the learner. Taken collectively, the data presented here suggest several points: (i) that iterated language learning experiments can provide us with new insights about the emergence and evolution of language; (ii) that language-like structure can emerge as a result of cultural transmission alone; and (iii) that whilst structure in these systems has the appearance of design, and is in some sense ‘created' by intentional beings, its emergence is in fact wholly the result of non-intentional processes. Put simply, cultural evolution plays a vital role in language. This work extends our framework for understanding it, and offers a new method for investigating it.},

The existence of structured mappings between phonological form and semantic mental representations has been shown to explain the nature of metaphor and pronominal anaphora in sign languages. With respect to processing, it is argued that psycholinguistic effects of iconicity may only be observed when the task specifically taps into such structured mappings. In addition, language acquisition effects may only be observed when the relevant cognitive abilities are in place (e.g. the ability to make structural comparisons) and when the relevant conceptual knowledge has been acquired (i.e. information key to processing the iconic mapping). Finally, it is suggested that iconicity is better understood as a structured mapping between two mental representations than as a link between linguistic form and human experience.},

This book traces the heritage of this linguistic naturalism back to its locus classicus, Plato's dialogue Cratylus. The first half of the book is a detailed examination of the linguistic arguments in the Cratylus. The second half follows three of the dialogue's naturalistic themes through subsequent linguistic history — natural grammar and conventional words, from Aristotle to Pinker; natural dialect and artificial language, from Varro to Chomsky; and invisible hierarchies, from Jakobson to Optimality Theory — in search of a way forward beyond these seductive yet spurious and limiting dichotomies.},

In doing so we provide the first experimental validation for the idea that cultural transmission can lead to the appearance of design without a designer. Our experiments involve the iterated learning of artificial languages by human participants. We show that languages transmitted culturally evolve in such a way as to maximize their own transmissibility: over time, the languages in our experiments become easier to learn and increasingly structured. Furthermore, this structure emerges purely as a consequence of the transmission of language over generations, without any intentional design on the part of individual language learners. Previous computational and mathematical models suggest that iterated learning provides an explanation for the structure of human language and link particular aspects of linguistic structure with particular constraints acting on language during its transmission. The experimental work presented here shows that the predictions of these models, and models of cultural evolution more generally, can be tested in the laboratory.},

However, there are numerous reported instances of systematic sound-meaning mappings in language, and this systematicity has been claimed to be important for early language development. In a large-scale corpus analysis of English, we show that sound-meaning mappings are more systematic than would be expected by chance. Furthermore, this systematicity is more pronounced for words involved in the early stages of language acquisition and reduces in later vocabulary development. We propose that the vocabulary is structured to enable systematicity in early language learning to promote language acquisition, while also incorporating arbitrariness for later language in order to facilitate communicative expressivity and efficiency.},

Enduring features of the theory have been a truth-conditional theory of meaning, a model-theoretic conception of semantics, and the methodological centrality of the Principle of Compositionality: “The meaning of a whole is a function of the meanings of its parts and their mode of syntactic combination.”},

  abstract = {Languages are culturally transmitted through a repeated cycle of learning and communicative interaction, a process known as iterated learning. Previous work has shown how different features of linguistic structure evolve from the trade-off between different competing pressures acting on language learning and communication such as compressibility and expressivity (Kirby, Cornish, {\&} Smith, 2008; Perfors, Tenenbaum, {\&} Regier, 2011; Lupyan {\&} Dale, 2015; Regier, Kemp, {\&} Kay, 2015; Kirby, Tamariz, Cornish, {\&} Smith, 2015). In Kirby et al. (2015), compositional miniature artificial languages evolve as a result of their transmission across “generations”. Where both compressibility and expressivity pressures are in play, signals in later generations are composed of atomic units, each mapping to a specific dimension of the meaning to be conveyed. However, the complexity of the languages which evolve in these experiments is necessarily limited by the objects (meanings) people were learning labels for. In particular, the sets of objects to be labelled do not require a language which exhibits hierarchical constituency and syntactic categories. In this paper, we increase the complexity of the meanings to be conveyed by including motion events that comprise shape, number, motion and aspect. The events are composed by a focal object which performs the action and optionally, an anchor object which remains static. By increasing the complexity of the meaning space, we expect the same mechanisms involved in the evolution of simple compositionality to lead to richer syntactic structure more closely resembling that found in real languages. We ran an Iterated Artificial Language Learning study and manipulated the expressivity pressure. We designed a monadic condition (N=32) with an artificial pressure for expressivity, and a dyadic condition (N=80) with communication as a natural pressure for expressivity. Following Kirby et al. (2015) we use the transmission chain paradigm. Participants were trained on a set of meaningsignal mappings, and then tested on their ability to recall that language. The first participants in a chain were trained on a non-compositional randomly generated language. Subsequent participants were trained on the language produced by the previous participants. The test phase of the monadic condition involved typing descriptions for motion event scenes using the language learned previously; participants were not allowed to reuse the same description for different meanings,introducing an artificial pressure for expressivity. The test phase in the dyadic condition required participants to communicate with their partner in the language that they previously learned; members of a dyad alternated between describing meanings for their partner, and interpreting descriptions provided by their partner. In accordance with previous results, we found a significant increase in learning success and structure in both conditions along the evolution of compositional structure. Moreover, constituency was hinted at by the emergence of morphologically complex N-like and V-like syntactic lexical categories. These categories were used to form hierarchically compositional sentential structures with meaningful word order. Despite the qualitative similarity of the results in the two conditions, we found that condition significantly affected the evolution of structure: languages in the dyadic condition became structured more rapidly and their level of structure was consistently higher. The levels of complexity in the emergent compositional systems were significantly different between conditions: the systems in the monadic condition showed higher system complexity on average and less transparent morphosyntactic structures (i.e. they exhibit functional elements such as category markers, and non-adjacent dependencies, not found in the dyadic condition). Compositionality operating at the levels of morphology and syntax evolved through the trade off between compressibility and expressivity. Nevertheless, the difference in complexity found between the two conditions points to the need for further investigation into the nature of the pressure for expressivity in these experiments. In the dyadic condition, the need to maintain communication may lead to a conservative approach. If participants find a solution that works, they stick with it. In the monadic condition, the pressure for expressivity is quite different. The need to avoid reuse of the same description for different meanings leads to an anticonservative approach, with participants actively generating novel signals. Future work should investigate whether an analog of this tendency to innovate is at play in real languages, and consequently whether a pressure for novelty needs to take its place alongside compressibility and expressivity in the evolution of complex linguistic structure.},

@article{Selten2007,
  abstract = {We investigate in a series of laboratory experiments how costs and benefits of linguistic communication affect the emergence of simple languages in a coordination task when no common language is available in the beginning. The experiment involved pairwise computerized communication between 152 subjects involved in at least 60 rounds. The subjects had to develop a common code referring to items in varying lists of geometrical figures distinguished by up to three features. A code had to be made of a limited repertoire of letters. Using letters had a cost. We are interested in the question of whether a common code is developed, and what enhances its emergence. Furthermore, we explore the emergence of compositional, protogrammatical structure in such codes. We compare environments that differ in terms of available linguistic resources (number of letters available) and in terms of stability of the task environment (variability in the set of figures). Our experiments show that a too small repertoire of letters causes coordination failures. Cost efficiency and role asymmetry are important factors enhancing communicative success. In stable environments, grammars do not seem to matter much, and instead efficient arbitrary codes often do better. However, in an environment with novelty, compositional grammars offer considerable coordination advantages and therefore are more likely to arise.},

  abstract = {Human languages may be shaped not only by the (individual psychological) processes of language acquisition, but also by population-level processes arising from repeated language learning and use. One prevalent feature of natural languages is that they avoid unpredictable variation. The current work explores whether linguistic predictability might result from a process of iterated learning in simple diffusion chains of adults. An iterated artificial language learning methodology was used, in which participants were organised into diffusion chains: the first individual in each chain was exposed to an artificial language which exhibited unpredictability in plural marking, and subsequent learners were exposed to the language produced by the previous learner in their chain. Diffusion chains, but not isolate learners, were found to cumulatively increase predictability of plural marking by lexicalising the choice of plural marker. This suggests that such gradual, cumulative population-level processes offer a possible explanation for regularity in language.},

  abstract = {The emergence of signaling systems has been observed in numerous experimental and real-world contexts, but there is no consensus on which (if any) shared mechanisms underlie such phenomena. A number of explanatory mechanisms have been proposed within several disciplines, all of which have been instantiated as credible working models. However, they are usually framed as being mutually incompatible. Using an exemplar-based framework, we replicate these models in a minimal configuration which allows us to directly compare them. This reveals that the development of optimal signaling is driven by similar mechanisms in each model, which leads us to propose three requirements for the emergence of conventional signaling. These are the creation and transmission of referential information, a systemic bias against ambiguity, and finally some form of information loss. Considering this, we then discuss some implications for theoretical and experimental approaches to the emergence of learned communication.},

  abstract = {This article presents three more-or-less-traditional considerations for compositionality. The first is that the usual statement of the compositionality principle is massively ambiguous. One of the eight available readings rules out all sources of multiplicity in meaning in complex expressions besides the lexicon and the syntax. Others are more permissive—how much more is not always clear. The second claim is that traditional considerations in favour of compositionality are less powerful than is often assumed. Compositionality is best construed as an empirical hypothesis on meanings expressed in natural languages. Finally, the third claim is that, even if compositionality is true, most of the debates in philosophy, linguistics, and psychology surrounding compositionality will remain open. These debates tend to be about significantly stronger theses.},

We illustrate this metric using the results of two artificial language learning experiments, which show that learners are sensitive, with a high level of individual variation, to systematic regularities in the input. Analysing language using this measure of regularity allows us to explore in detail how language learning and language use can both generate linguistic variation, leading to language change, and potentially complexify language structure, leading to qualitative language evolution.},

  abstract = {It is well established that context plays a fundamental role in how we learn and use language. Here we explore how context links short-term language use with the long-term emergence of different types of language system. Using an iterated learning model of cultural transmission, the current study experimentally investigates the role of the communicative situation in which an utterance is produced ( situational context ) and how it influences the emergence of three types of linguistic systems: underspecified languages (where only some dimensions of meaning are encoded linguistically), holistic systems (lacking systematic structure), and systematic languages (consisting of compound signals encoding both category-level and individuating dimensions of meaning). To do this, we set up a discrimination task in a communication game and manipulated whether the feature dimension shape was relevant or not in discriminating between two referents. The experimental languages gradually evolved to encode information relevant to the task of achieving communicative success, given the situational context in which they are learned and used, resulting in the emergence of different linguistic systems. These results suggest language systems adapt to their contextual niche over iterated learning.},
